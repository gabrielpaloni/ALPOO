A comprehensive academic repository for the **ALPOO (Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming)** coursework. This project documents my technical evolution in **Computer Science**, focusing on the mastery of Java syntax, class architecture, and the fundamental pillars of modern software development.

## 📂 Coursework Modules & Concepts

The repository is organized to demonstrate the practical application of theoretical concepts, from basic logic to complex class hierarchies:

### 1. 🏗️ Object-Oriented Foundations
* **Encapsulation:** Implementation of secure data access using private modifiers and public interfaces (Getters/Setters).
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Designing flexible systems where child classes extend functionality and override behaviors dynamically.
* **Abstraction:** Creation of strict contracts using Interfaces and Abstract Classes to standardize system behavior.

### 2. ⚙️ Data Structures & Logic
* **Java Collections Framework:** Efficient manipulation of data using `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `HashSet`.
* **Exception Handling:** Robust error management using `try-catch` blocks and custom exception hierarchies to ensure runtime stability.
* **Algorithmic Logic:** Implementation of sorting, searching, and data processing algorithms within an object-oriented context.

### 3. 🧩 Design & Architecture
* **Class Modeling:** Translating real-world entities into code using clean architecture principles.
* **Clean Code:** Adherence to standard naming conventions and modularization to ensure readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **Paradigm:** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
* **Version Control:** Git

## 🚀 How to Explore
Since this repository contains multiple isolated exercises and modules:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/gabrielpaloni/ALPOO.git](https://github.com/gabrielpaloni/ALPOO.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate:**
    Open the project in your IDE. Each subfolder typically represents a specific topic (e.g., `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`).
3.  **Execute:**
    Locate the `Main.java` file within the desired module and run it to see the logic in action.
